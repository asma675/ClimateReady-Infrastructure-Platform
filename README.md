# ResilientGov

A Vite + React demo app for climate risk visualization and public investment prioritization.

## Run locally

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Build

```bash
npm run build
```

## Data

The app uses a local-first data layer backed by browser `localStorage` with seeded demo data, so it runs anywhere (including Vercel) without external services.
